I'm a software developer mostly focused on UI design in .NET desktop applications. I also work on web projects (Firebase, Vue), OpenSceneGraph-based C++ projects, virtual reality, augumented reality, Unity, Android and a ROS project for a terrestrial drone autonomous guidance. I'm also a 2D/3D artist and I use Blender for pretty much anything that has to do with graphics.

My main project is [TCC](https://github.com/Foglio1024/Tera-custom-cooldowns).
